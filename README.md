> A complete CSS framework for [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)

* * *

**kouto swiss** is a complete CSS framework for Stylus, inspired by great tools like nib, compass, bourbonâ€¦

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install kouto-swiss
```

## Usage

### Included in compilation, with grunt or gulp.

#### Grunt

For grunt, you can use [grunt-contrib-stylus](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-stylus), and include **kouto swiss** in your `use` option for the task.

You can also use [grunt-ks-stylus](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-ks-stylus), which is a fork of **grunt-contrib-stylus**, with **kouto swiss** included.

#### Gulp

For gulp, use [gulp-stylus](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-stylus) and include **kouto swiss** in your `use` option for the task.

### As middleware, for *on the fly* compilation.

There's an exemple of how to use stylus with kouto-swiss within Connect or Express.

```javascript
var connect = require( "connect" ),
    stylus = require( "stylus" ),
    koutoSwiss = require( "kouto-swiss" ),
    server = connect();
    
function compile( str, path ) {
    return stylus( str )
        .set( "filename", path )
        .set( "compress", true )
        .use( koutoSwiss() );
}

server.use( stylus.middleware( {
    src: __dirname,
    compile: compile
} ) );
    
```

## Stylus API

To gain access to the kouto swiss tools from your Stylus files, simply add:

```stylus
@import "kouto-swiss"
```

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.  
Add unit tests and update the docs for any new or changed functionality.  
More informations in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

### Special call for contribution : something who write better english than mine !

> As you can guess from my spelling, english **isn't** my first language. And as I make prodigious efforts to try, I still can't write good and readable documentation as a native speaker should.

If you want to help the **kouto swiss** project, but don't want to write code, please, consider a little review of the docs, correcting my *very bad* english.  
Many thanks !
