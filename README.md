## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.  
Add unit tests and update the docs for any new or changed functionality.

### Special call for contribution : something who write better english than mine !

> As you can guess by my spelling, english isn't my first language. And as I make prodigious efforts to try, I still can't write good and readable documentation as a native speaker should.

If you want to help the **kouto swiss** project, but don't want to write code, please, consider a little review of the docs, correcting my *very bad* english.  
Many thanks !
